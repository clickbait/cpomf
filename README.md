# cpomf

pomf backend written in crystal for pomf.is

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Postgres
- Mschematool
- Crystal 0.20.4

### Setup
Set your environment variables:

- `POMF_PORT` - The port that cpomf listens to.
- `POMF_DEBUG` - Whether or not cpomf is in debug mode true|false
- `POMF_DATABASE_URL` - The postgres URL for your database, eg; `postgres://localhost/pomf_database`
- `POMF_SECRET_KEY` - Your secret key; preferably something that's long and randomly generated.
- `POMF_ADMINS` - A comma seperated list of admin usernames; keeping in mind that usernames are lowercase and alphanumeric only.
- `POMF_BLACKLISTED_NAMES` - A comma seperated list of banned usernames; it's usually good to blacklist names like admin or anything else you don't want users to use.
- `POMF_UPLOAD_DIR` - Relative path to your pomf upload directory.
- `POMF_URL` - the root URL of your site; eg. `https://pomf.is/`
- `POMF_UPLOAD_URL` - The upload URL for your site; eg. `https://u.pomf.is/`

Run `shards install` to install dependencies.

Run `mschematool default init_db` and then `mschematool default sync`

Compile the project with `crystal build --release pomf.cr`

## Usage

Run cpomf like you would run any other binary file `./pomf`

Use a nginx reverse proxy to cpomf; and use nginx to handle static files, including those in /src/pomf/public; google tutorials if you need to.

Please make sure that you modify the default templates and styles before you host your own clone; I've left nya.is' designs in as a reference, but being unique is king in a sea of clones.

Make sure you create your account before you release your site.
